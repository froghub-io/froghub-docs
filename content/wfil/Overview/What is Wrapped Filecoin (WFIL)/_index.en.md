At first, it might seem confusing why we have a token like WFIL. Don't we already have FIL on the Filecoin blockchain anyway? The first thing to understand is that not every token on Filecoin is technically alike. The network allows developers to create new rules and standards for cryptocurrencies.

One example would be the ERC-721 format that gives us Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). These act very differently from FIlecoin or ERC-20 tokens. Developers have a lot of room for customization when creating these digital assets. So while FIL can be used to pay for gas fees on Filecoin, FIL can't be used in every DApp.

Most DeFi DApps nowadays accept ERC-20 tokens for investment and staking opportunities. If we want to add FIL to a liquidity pool or use it as collateral, it's much easier to have it in an ERC-20 version. This provides the most compatibility across the blockchain and saves time developing new smart contracts.
