The process of generating WFIL is simple - you send your FIL to a smart contract that then provides WFIL in return. This means that all WFIL created is backed up completely by FIL reserves. Your FIL is locked in the smart contract and can be exchanged back at any time for WFIL. When your FIL is returned, the contract burns the supplied WFIL.

To wrap FIL, you can interact directly with the WFIL smart contract, so that it takes your FIL and credits your wallet with WFIL at a 1:1 ratio (you still have to pay for transaction fees). Converting back requires another smart contract interaction, but the process is pretty much the same.

However, it's much easier to swap another token for WFIL using a crypto exchange. Letâ€™s see how you can swap your FIL for WFIL using the Uniswap DEX or directly through your Metamask wallet.
