Wrapped Filecoin (WFIL) is a token pegged to Filecoin (FIL). WFIL is used in several platforms and DApps that support ERC-20 tokens. While FIL is used to pay for network transaction fees, it doesn't have the same functionality as ERC-20 tokens.

You can easily convert FIL into WFIL through a process known as wrapping. You can also convert WFIL back into FIL at any time. Both wrapping and unwrapping follow a 1:1 ratio, meaning there are no extra costs apart from transaction fees.

You can wrap your FIL manually by interacting with the WFIL smart contract, which will store your FIL and give you back the exact same amount of WFIL.

Filecoin's DeFi ecosystem is large, and using WFIL provides more opportunities for staking and investing. There are many versions of WFIL, but some are more popular than others. You can even find wrapped FIL on other blockchains to use in their ecosystems. Popular uses for WFIL include NFTs trading, providing liquidity to liquidity pools, and crypto lending.
